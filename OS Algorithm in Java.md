# OS Algorithm Implementation in Java

# Project Description

## This project involves the implementation of various Operating System (OS) algorithms using the Java programming language. The primary aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these algorithms function and their applications in managing system resources efficiently. The project covers essential OS algorithms such as process scheduling, memory management, and file systems.
## Operating systems are crucial for managing hardware and software resources on a computer. They ensure that different programs and users running simultaneously do not interfere with each other. This project focuses on simulating these processes through Java, offering insights into the inner workings of an operating system.
