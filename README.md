Motivation:

The motivation behind this project is to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application of OS algorithms. By implementing these algorithms in Java, users can gain insights into their workings, performance characteristics, and potential use cases within real-world systems.

Key Features:

Process Scheduling Algorithms: Includes implementations of First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling.

Memory Management Algorithms: Demonstrates techniques such as Paging, Segmentation, and Virtual Memory management.

Disk Scheduling Algorithms: Covers algorithms like FCFS Disk Scheduling, Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), and Elevator (SCAN) algorithm.

Synchronization Mechanisms: Implements classic synchronization problems such as Producer-Consumer, Readers-Writers, and Dining Philosophers using semaphores and monitors.

Installation Instructions:

Clone the Repository: Use git clone to download the project files to your local machine.

Set Up Environment: Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed on your system. Configure your IDE to use the correct JDK version.

Build the Project: Use Maven or Gradle build tools if provided; otherwise, compile using javac.

Run Examples: Execute the main classes corresponding to each algorithm to see them in action.
